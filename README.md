API found here: https://sidewalk-sea.cs.washington.edu/api.This project not only introduced me to how code can be used for accessibility projects, but was also used by RIT in a dataset of Dijkstra implementations.

- A repository containing templates for both beginner and advanced Data Structures supported by LeetCode problems and Projects.
    - [DataStructuresTemplate](https://github.com/Sammontalbano22/DataStructureTemplates)

- During my internship seeking journey, I found it difficult to constantly update my resume to match Job Descriptions while still maintaing a successful ATS compliant template, so I created a ResumeBuilding program that allows for easy updating with GPT 4.0 assistance.

- This year for my dad's birthday I created a Stardew-Valley style game highlighting our many outdoor adventures. For this project I used the Unity game engine. Not only did this improve my understanding of game development, but it also helped with my understanding of C#.
